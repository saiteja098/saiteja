          <p><em>Hi, I'm Sai Teja, I'm a multi-talented human. Right now I'm doing my bachelor's degree on mechanical engineering in sv university.</em><br/>
            <br/>
              3 years back I found my interest in design and building softwares.
              Right from then I have build android apps, games and web applications 
              using different programming languages, libraries, frameworks and softwares.
              <br /><br/>
             I gained lot of knowledge and experience in computers science during this process through projects and readings.
             I can do front-end development, back-end development.<br />
             <br />
             My personality type is <a alt="ENTJ meaning" href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTJ.html">ENTJ</a>.
             I don't like define myself by the work I'hv done. I define myself by the work I want to do.
             Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I always tend to learning new things.
             I'm never satisfied to just come up with ideas. 
             Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.<br />
             <br/>
             These days I'm learning artificial intelligence to work on my idea which is related to that subject.
             My interests are broad. Music enthusiast, Engineer, photographer, love travelling and hiking in forests.
             and also I'm Good at maths and physics.
             <br />
             I'm looking farward to have a good career in software development and become best in it.
